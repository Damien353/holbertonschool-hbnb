# HBnB - Part 2: Implementation of Business Logic and API Endpoints

## Introduction

This phase of the HBnB Project focuses on implementing the core functionality of the application using Python and Flask. The goal is to build the Presentation Layer (API) and the Business Logic Layer, ensuring that the application structure follows the documented design from the previous phase.

This part of the project includes setting up the project structure, developing the business logic, and implementing CRUD operations for managing users, places, reviews, and amenities.

## Project Vision and Scope

This part establishes a functional and scalable foundation for the application by implementing:

### 1. Business Logic Layer

- Defining core models and logic for managing the application's functionality.
- Establishing relationships between entities (e.g., Users, Places, Reviews, Amenities).
- Implementing data validation and business rules.
- Using the Facade pattern to simplify interactions between the Presentation and Business Logic layers.

### 2. Presentation Layer (API)

- Defining the RESTful API endpoints using Flask and flask-restx.
- Structuring the API with clear paths and parameters.
- Implementing data serialization to return related objects (e.g., when retrieving a Place, include details such as the owner's name and associated amenities).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Project Structure Setup

- Organized the project into a modular architecture.
- Created packages for Presentation (API) and Business Logic layers.

### 2. Business Logic Implementation

Developed core classes:
- **User**: Handles user creation and updates.
- **Place**: Manages property listings.
- **Review**: Stores user reviews for places.
- **Amenity**: Lists features available for a place.

Established relationships between these entities.
Applied input validation and data integrity checks.

### 3. API Endpoints

Implemented CRUD operations using Flask-RESTx:

- **Users API**: POST, GET, PUT endpoints to manage users.
- **Places API**: POST, GET, PUT endpoints to handle places.
- **Reviews API**:
    - `POST /reviews/` - Create a new review.
    - `GET /reviews/` - Retrieve all reviews.
    - `GET /reviews/<review_id>` - Get a specific review.
    - `PUT /reviews/<review_id>` - Update a review.
    - `DELETE /reviews/<review_id>` - Delete a review.
    - `GET /places/<place_id>/reviews` - Retrieve reviews for a place.
- **Amenities API**: POST, GET, PUT endpoints to manage amenities.

### 4. Testing and Validation

Implemented unit tests using `unittest` to verify:
- Business logic behavior.
- API response consistency.
- Handling of edge cases.

Used Postman and cURL for manual testing.

## Setup and Running the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed, then install required dependencies:

```bash
pip install flask flask-restx
```

### 2. Run the API

Navigate to the project directory and start the Flask server:

```python
python run.py
```

The API will be available at:

```http
http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/v1/
```
